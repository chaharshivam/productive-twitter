# Productive twitter

> Twitter theme to increase productivity as per changes in July 2019.

This version of twitter is very hard to override, so this extension is opinionated. You'll get the best results if you're using dim mode with blue (go into the more section of the left sidebar, click display, check DIM and blue).

If you don't want blue, no problem! You might want to fork this and change line 90 of `override.css` to the color of your choice. That's really the only thing that's pink.

_Fair warning: I don't have a lot of time to maintain this and am not really taking feature requests- it's something I made in one sitting that I use, and people asked me to open source. Please feel free to enjoy it and fork it for your own tweaks! You can always ask for bug fixes and features, but I'm not likely to work on them unless I really want the change, too. All that said, please enjoy! üçª_
